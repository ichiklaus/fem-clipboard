## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I developed a better understanding of flexbox by doing this project. I still struggle with the visual spacing part, but a way I learned to work with this is by drawing borders to these containers, this really helps a lot if you don't know where your spaces/margins/paddings are.


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: var(); 
  background-image: url(../images/bg-header-desktop.png), linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(255,255,255,1), rgba(255,255,255,1));
  filter: invert(54%) sepia(86%) saturate(369%) hue-rotate(121deg) brightness(96%) contrast(89%);
}
```



### Continued development

Flexbox.
CSS grid.
Mobile-first workflow.



### Useful resources

- [To change any SVG Color] https://stackoverflow.com/a/53336754 - This helped me to filter an SVG to a specific color using a color to filter converter.
- [CSS filter generator to convert from black to target hex color](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
